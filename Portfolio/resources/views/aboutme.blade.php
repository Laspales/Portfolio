        <p> I'm <span>Epalla Ndjalla Laspales</span>, a student from Cameroon. Currently,
            I'm continuing my studies at ETNA in Ivry-Sur-Seine, where I'm registered as a

            also a period at 3IL in Limoges, where I studied computer engineering (BAC+3),
            as well as at PREPAVOGT in Yaound√© (Cameroon) , where I studied general engineering from September 2018 to July 2021.
